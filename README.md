### Game Description
"Guess What And GO" is a board game that encourages the user to keep answering questions and finish the game first! The board has numbered and grid squares which contain various challenges for the player. The squares might have "positive" or "negative" puzzles! If it is positive, the game awards you with several steps ahead if you answer correctly, otherwise you stay steady. If it is negative, you stay steady if you give the right answer, but if you don't, the game punishes you by regressing some squares back.
